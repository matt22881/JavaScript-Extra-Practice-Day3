TASK 1 ðŸš€
// in your own words explain what a closure is below in comments and then write an example of a closure. Try to make this explaination simple enough to explain to a younger sibling. */

//* closure is when a function has to reach outside it own scope into a parent's to get a value for a variable...my youngest sister is 28 and i think she'd get it


//   function calculator(num1, num2, callback){
//     return callback(num1, num2)

//   const multiply = (num1, num2) => num1 * num2;
//   const divide = (num1, num2) => num1 / num2;

TASK 2 ðŸš€
// look at the code below and explain in your own words where the variable 'count' is available.
// Explain why 'count' is initialized with a let and not a var or const.
// Explain how initalizing the variable 'count' with a var would change it's scope

//* count is only available inside the counterMaker function, this why it's initialized with a let, a var initilizer would make it's scope global which is not what we want to do.

TASK 3 ðŸš€

* 1.  in the global scope, 'this' refers to the window, or in other words the whole enviornment
* 2.  in a typical method call, 'this' refers to the object using the method, located to the left of the dot like this -> object.method(arg))
* 3.  in a constructor function it's the new object
* 4.  in a .call or .apply method call it's always the first argument passed
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above

TASK 4 ðŸš€
/*
  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance hierarchy.
  In this file you will be creating three constructor functions: GameObject, CharacterStats, Humanoid.
  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all end up inheriting from Humanoid.  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your constructor functions.

  Each constructor function has unique properties and methods that are defined in their block comments below:
